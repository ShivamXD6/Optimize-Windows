## ❓ What to choose for installation?
> [!TIP]  
> **Ventoy** is recommended for users who don't frequently format their USB drives or want to include drivers during installation.  
> **Rufus**, on the other hand, is ideal for those who prefer a quick and simple installation and don't mind formatting the drive and installing drivers afterward.

## 🔧 Installation with Ventoy

### 1. Prepare Your USB Drive
1. Create a bootable USB drive using [Ventoy](https://ventoy.net/).
2. Download the [Optimize-Windows.zip](https://github.com/ShivamXD6/Optimize-Windows/releases/latest/download/Optimize-Windows.zip).
3. Extract the contents of `Optimize-Windows.zip` into your USB drive.
